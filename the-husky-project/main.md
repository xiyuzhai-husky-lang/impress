Next Generation AI + Next Generation Programming

TODO: make this a tablet

in ppt, first give each a slide, then combine to a table in a single slide

(in the following, model is measured in terms of accuracy, speed, robustness and explainability)

Traditional Computer Vision: Human Feature Selectioin -> Tradition ML -> Okay Model with some explainability(accountability)

Deep learning: Big Data -> Huge GPU Time -> Good Model with little explainability(accountability)

Husky: Data + Moderate CPU time + Human + Programming Language Design ?-> Near Optimal Model with (almost) full explainability(accountability)

## Motivation

Observation: The most natural hypothesis class can be statistically simple but computationally hard.

Give examples in MNIST

DL and Traditional machine learning deal with statistical and computational challenge using the same
