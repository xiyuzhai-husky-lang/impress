# Research

A typical deep learning research

- doesn't take much domain specific understanding
- doesn't take much algorithms and data structure understanding
- no software architecture understanding
- no theoretical understanding

Deep learning demands significant computing resources. This leads to monopoly, i.e. only big companies can do research.

Husky is academia-friendly. It's more intelligence oriented. Personal computer with only CPU is absolutely fine for ImageNet tasks. It probably can work well in the 90s.

## Theory

It has to be pointed out that so far, there is no successful theoretical analysis of deep learning.

On the other hand, our project easily analyzed from theoretical point of view
