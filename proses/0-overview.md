# Overview

We claim there exists a multitude of programs for computer vision tasks superior over deep learning that are

- as accurate or more
- much more efficient
- truly robustness
- fully explainable, just like a software.

But they haven't been discovered yet because of two obstacles:

- lack of an accurate and powerful mathematical modeling of shape information
- difficulty in combining software engineering and machine learning

In the last five years, we believe that we solved the two obstacles with

- a family of shape description algorithms inspired by sketching in painting
- a new programming language called husky, which combines the good

- significantly easier to obtain, even without GPUs (with tools we invent).
