# Overview

We claim there exists computer vision models undiscovered superior over deep learning:

- accuracy: equal or higher
- inference efficiency: 20 times faster for MNIST, 100 times faster for ImageNet
- robustness: theoretically provable
- explainability: just like software engineering.

But they haven't been discovered yet because of two obstacles:

- lack of an accurate and powerful mathematical modeling of shape information
- difficulty in combining software engineering and machine learning

In the last five years, we believe that we solved the two obstacles with

- a family of shape description algorithms inspired by sketching in painting
- a new programming language called husky, which combines the good

- significantly easier to obtain, even without GPUs (with tools we invent).
