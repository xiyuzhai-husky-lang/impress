# Overview

Deep learning has achieved a lot, but we claim it's still far away from optimal.

The insight is that: an AI problem typically involves both statistical and computational challenge, yet deep learning is mostly about function fitting under statistical loss using matrix operations. It can't invent new algorithms and data structures. As a result, it's inefficient, hard to train, volatile, and inexplainable.

We shall exhibit a new AI paradigm fundamentally different from deep learning.

## Prediction

The "models" become prediction programs that is equally or more accurate, efficient, robust and explanable.

True machine learning shouldn't be limited to matrix operations.

Deep learning doesn't exhaust the full potential of machines.

For example, no algorithm for quick sort is about matrix operations.

Matrix is just a limitation of contemporary machine learning.

Machine learning is not just about matrices, but about any program runnable on a machine.

Deep learning can be accurate, but it can't be efficient, robust, explainable at the same time, because it affords only matrix operations.

## Development

The "training processes" become software development that is significantly cheaper, predictable, explainable, accumulative and maintable.

go beyond sgd

Human expertise can't combine with SGD.

We replace matrix operations with functions over geometric objects instead.
